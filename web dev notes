DRY : Don't Repeat Yourself
We want to keep our code as DRY as possible. It saves us a lot of time and makes our code cleaner.

While Loops: Repeat code WHILE a condition is true
while(someCondition) {
    //run some code
}

They are very similar to if statements, except they repeat a given code block instead of just running it once:

>Printing each character in a string..
//string we're looping over:
var str = "hello";
//first character is at index 0
var count = 0;
while (count < str.length) {
console.log(str[count]);
count++;
}
